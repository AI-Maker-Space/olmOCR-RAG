    "In this notebook, we built a complete RAG pipeline for D&D rules using LangChain 1.0:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Indexed** 3 D&D rulebook documents (markdown format) into Qdrant vector store\n",
    "2. **Created a RAG Agent** with a retrieval tool for flexible, multi-step queries\n",
    "3. **Created a RAG Chain** with middleware for fast, single-call Q&A\n",

    "### Key Takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "| Component | Purpose |\n",
    "|-----------|--------|\n",
    "| `DirectoryLoader` | Load markdown files from disk |\n",
    "| `RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter` | Split documents into retrievable chunks |\n",
    "| `QdrantVectorStore` | Store and search embeddings |\n",
    "| `@tool` decorator | Create retrieval tool for agent |\n",
    "| `create_agent` | Build LangChain 1.0 agent |\n",
    "| `AgentMiddleware` | Inject context for RAG chain |\n",
    "\n",
    "### Next Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "- Add conversational memory for multi-turn interactions\n",
    "- Deploy with LangServe for API access\n",
    "- Add more rulebooks to the knowledge base\n",
    "- Implement query rewriting for better retrieval"
